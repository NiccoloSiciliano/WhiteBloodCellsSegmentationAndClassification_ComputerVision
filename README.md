# White Blood Cells Classification and Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **classification** and **segmentation** of **White Blood Cells (WBCs)** using deep learning models. The goal is to first segment WBCs from images and then classify them based on their type using different CNN-based architectures.
Further details about the project are given in the [Presentation](./Presentation.pptx) pptx file.

### Models:
Models have to be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-N9mb5mG_IlBru4mT2z65VMVEsPRzu4J?usp=drive_link
- **Segmentation**:  
  1. **ReducedUnet**: A lightweight version of the well-known U-Net architecture for WBC segmentation.
  2. **DoubleDecArch**: A custom CNN model with an encoder-decoder architecture and a double decoder for enhanced segmentation.
  
- **Classification**:  
  1. **Arch1**: A simple CNN architecture for classifying WBCs from raw cell images.
  2. **Combined Image Classifier**: A variant of `Arch1` that uses combined input from the segmented mask and the original image.

## Architecture Details

### Segmentation
1. **ReducedUnet**:
   - A reduced version of the U-Net architecture designed to be computationally lighter while maintaining effective segmentation performance.
   - **Architecture**: 
     - Encoder and decoder paths.
     - Skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers for efficient segmentation.
     - Output: Segmentation masks for WBCs.

2. **DoubleDecArch**:
   - A CNN model based on an encoder-decoder architecture but with a **double decoder** to improve segmentation results.
   - **Architecture**: 
     - The encoder extracts features from the input image.
     - Two separate decoder branches process the features to refine the segmentation.
     - Output: Segmentation masks with enhanced detail through dual decoders.

### Classification
1. **Arch1**:
   - A simple CNN classifier that takes WBC images as input and classifies them into their respective categories.
   - **Input**: Raw WBC image.
   - **Output**: Cell type classification.

2. **Combined Image Classifier**:
   - This model is an alternative to `Arch1`, with the same architecture but a different input.
   - **Input**: A combined image that merges the segmented mask and the original image, providing additional features for classification.
   - **Output**: Cell type classification based on combined input.
